                Happy Birthday, Ruth! 🎉<br><br>

                I can't tell you how much you mean to me. Ever since our paths crossed, you've brightened my life in the
                most amazing ways, and I’m beyond grateful for every single moment we share. Today, I hope your day is
                overflowing with joy, laughter, and all the love your beautiful heart deserves. 💖


                <br><br>
                If I could teleport, I'd be there right now to give you the biggest hug ever and make your day even more
                special! But since I can’t, I wanted to create something from my heart—something that shows just how
                much I care about you. It might not be a grand gift, but it’s filled with all the love I have for you.
                🎁


                <br><br>
                Wishing you all the happiness in the world, and I hope you enjoy your day to the fullest! If I could,
                I’d be right there to make sure of it. 😊<br><br>
                With lots of love,<br>
                Your Gee 💙
